Welcome to audio recoder / transcriber! This application allows you to record audio and transcribe it using OpenAI Text. 
The transcribed result will be automatically copied to the clipboard.

- Rename the env.template file to .env.
- Open the .env file and provide your OpenAI API key: `OPENAI_KEY=your-api-key`
- Install the dependencies: `npm install`

## Usage

This will start the application on localhost:3000, and you can begin recording audio. The transcribed result will be automatically copied to the clipboard.
