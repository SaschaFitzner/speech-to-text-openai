# Audio Recorder / Transcriber

**Author Sascha Fitzner - fitznerIO**

Welcome to the Audio Recorder / Transcriber! This application allows you to record audio and transcribe it using OpenAI Wisper. Additionally, it provides a feature that can translate the transcribed text directly into English. The result, whether transcribed or translated, is then automatically copied to your clipboard for ease of use.

## Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

- Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/SaschaFitzner/speech-to-text-openai`
- Navigate to the project directory: `cd speech-to-text-openai`
- Rename the env.template file to .env.
- Open the .env file and provide your OpenAI API key: `OPENAI_KEY=your-api-key`
- Install the dependencies: `npm install`

## Usage
To start the application, use the following command:

`npm start`

This will start the application on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), and you can begin recording audio. The transcribed result will be automatically copied to the clipboard.

Additionally, you can use the command `npm run build` to trigger a build of the application using pkg. The built image will be saved in the dist folder.

### Usage Note
Please note that using this application requires recording your voice. Before you can start recording, you need to grant permission for the browser to access your microphone.

Additionally, the transcribed text will be automatically copied to the clipboard. You can then use the copied text in other applications or programs.

Make sure you are using an up-to-date version of your browser on your device and have installed the latest updates to ensure optimal functionality.
